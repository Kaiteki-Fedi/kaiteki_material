# Kaiteki Material

Kaiteki's generic components based on Material Design.

## Features

- Material 1 - 3 widgets (not provided in Flutter *yet*)
- Widgets for working with asynchronous operations
- Utilities

## Goals of the example application

The example application tries to implement the Material Design sketches as close as possible, in order to find out what is missing in Flutter's Material Design implementation and to document the workarounds and possibly provide them as a ready-to-use package.
